# SNEST
## SNES USB Controller Tester

SNEST.py is a simple script that uses the pygame (SDL-based) control of
SNES USB controller. The output is tracked via a simple ASCII NCurses
output. The controller state is stored in classic bitwise fashion, so the
state hex can be sent easily to external hardware using serial
communication. It has been tested using a Buffalo Classic USB SNES gamepad.
